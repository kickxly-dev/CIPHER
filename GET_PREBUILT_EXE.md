# ðŸŽ¯ GET PRE-BUILT CIPHER.EXE

Since you need a **ready-made EXE** with no compilation, here are your options:

## Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)
I can create a GitHub repository with automated builds that generate the EXE for download:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions automatically compiles
3. Download ready EXE from Releases
4. Users get direct download link

## Option 2: Use Online Build Service
Services like:
- **Replit** - Can compile and host
- **CodeSandbox** - Online compilation
- **Gitpod** - Cloud development with builds

## Option 3: Pre-compiled Binary
I need access to a Windows system with a compiler to create the actual EXE file. Since I can't compile directly, you'll need:

1. Someone with Visual Studio/MinGW to compile once
2. Upload the EXE to file hosting (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
3. Share download link

## ðŸš€ **Immediate Solution:**
Would you like me to:
1. Create a GitHub repo with auto-build?
2. Set up online compilation service?
3. Provide instructions for someone to compile once?

The end result will be: **Direct download link â†’ Cipher.exe â†’ Double-click to run**

Which option works best for you?
