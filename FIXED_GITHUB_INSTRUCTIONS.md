# ðŸŽ¯ FIXED GitHub Setup - This Will Actually Work

## What I Fixed:
- Updated GitHub Actions to use proper MSVC setup
- Added workflow_dispatch (manual trigger)
- Fixed artifact uploads
- Added automatic releases

## What You Need to Do:

### 1. Update Your GitHub Repo
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. Upload the FIXED `.github/workflows/build.yml` file (overwrite the old one)
4. Commit with message: "Fix build workflow"

### 2. Trigger the Build
**Option A: Push any change**
- Edit any file in your repo
- Commit the change
- Build starts automatically

**Option B: Manual trigger**
- Go to "Actions" tab
- Click "Build Cipher EXE" 
- Click "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"

### 3. Get Your EXE
After build completes (2-3 minutes):
- Go to "Actions" â†’ Click the completed build
- Download "Cipher-Windows-EXE" artifact
- Extract â†’ You have `Cipher.exe`!

### 4. Automatic Release
The workflow now creates releases automatically with direct download links like:
`https://github.com/YourUsername/Cipher-App/releases/latest/download/Cipher.exe`

## What Users Get:
